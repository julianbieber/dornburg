# Story outline

This document should provide a rough sketch of how the game should look and evolve. We want to have concise narrative
that is rooted in a fever dream like state of a writer that searches for the remains of his friend. We are leaning on the
inspiration provided by the story of Goethe and Schiller, in which Goethe stole the remains of Schiller and used Schiller's
skull as inspiration and a remembrance to his passed away colleague and friend. Which was later found to never being Schiller's.

Setting the stage is a color- and shape-shifting world surrounding the player character who "woke up" in the middle of
a strange world. Starting his journey to collect the remains that he is seemingly drawn toward.

## Stage 1

* Simple geometry, getting familiar with the concepts of this jump and run
* There is a "timer" at the top in form of a poem that cycles through its verses, dictating the shifting world
* Story drop, maybe some text boxes given hints of context
* Familiarize with goal -> find skulls / bones -> proceed to exit

The player finds himself in a strange world that changes where he doesn't look. Fairly close there is a skull.
Approaching it, it will provide context for the strange dreamlike world we are in. But tell it in a strange way hinting
at loss of a friend and a deteriorating mental state of the player. You drop the skull to the ground and continue.

## Stage 2

* More complex geometry
* More bones to collect

The player continues to experience the strange shifting world and explores more. Collecting a bunch of bones and finding
a slightly different looking skull at the exit. It speaks to the player and states arbitrary nonsense and context clues.
The player decides to take the skull with him. Maybe the skull knows more.

## Stage 3

* Very difficult geometry
* More bones to collect
* Multiple skulls (all unique) to collect -> each one drops more context clues to an overarching plot

The player reaches the most difficult stage that contains more bones and more skulls. Each time a player collect a skull,
they are given more text about that this is a dream and that this is about his grief of a lost friend.

## Stage 4

* Last stage
* More of an epilogue
* Player makes a final choice before waking up in a cold sweat

The player character is running toward the last exit which will free him from the nightmare they are in. They are
stopped right before the end. They can select one of all the skulls they collected. Giving a specific end screen/message
before cutting to an end scene.

## End scene
Player wakes up in a cold sweat, with a skull beside them. They look toward the skull, fade to black.

## Intended take away
The player is a writer, similar to Goethe. And has a skull that they believe to be of the lost friend (like Schiller) but
its not and all skulls they found also weren't. Testing all skull options will not change this. Implying that the first
skull in stage 1 might have been of his friend. But even that one looks different to the one shown in the last scene.
hinting that they really got the wrong skull.
