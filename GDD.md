## Theme: Exremely incohesive feverdream

## Game Concept
You play a 2d platformer with a time dimension, which varies the intensity of different game mechanics, like gravity according to a noise function taking in you coordinate and time since stage start.
The time is displayed as words of a (set of) poems.
The world is ever changing, with greater change further from the players position.

## Core Gameplay Mechanics
- Platform through different stages, with when you die, respawn at the start of the stage
- Connection between start and end variable, as the geometry of the level evolves
- Time since revive impacts the strength of player impacting the physics mechanics (gravity, friction, wind)
- There is a bubble around the player, where the world does not evolve, with a section of increasing impact

## Controls
- Keyboard
- A: move left
- D: move right
- Space: Jump


## Art Style
Runny oil paint in the background, merging more with the terrain as time progresses.

## Audio
[Sound effects approach]
[Music style/genre]

## Levels/Progression
Over the first levels, your goal is to get to a skull.
As a progression to make the next stages harder, you gather 3 different bones in later stages.

As you progress through stages, introduce more physics concepts that impact the player movement.

At the end of every stage, you ask the skull: Are you schiller? And it responds with gibberish text.
At the end of the game you find, that the original skull is Schiller.

## Win/Lose Conditions
Player wins a stage by reaching/gathering the available bones
Player wins the game by winning all stages
Player loses a stage by hitting any "kill" block


## Stretch Goals (If time permits)
1. [Feature that would be nice to have]
2. [Additional content]
3. [Extra polish]
